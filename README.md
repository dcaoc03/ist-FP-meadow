# Meadow Ecosystem Simulation
This was the second project I developed for the Foundations of Programming course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in the school year 2021/2022. A Python program which simulates the interactions between the animals and the environment in a meadow.

The project was mostly written in Portuguese.
